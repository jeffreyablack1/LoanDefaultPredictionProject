Credit Risk Analysis (Showcasing the skillset of Jeffrey Black for Classification ML development)

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing credit risk using various machine learning models. The analysis encompasses preprocessing, an exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and a description of findings based on the credit_risk_dataset.csv data.

Project Structure

Data Folder: Contains the credit_risk_dataset.csv data used for this project.
Models Folder: Houses the .pkl files for the top three models from the experiment.
Notebooks Folder:
DataScientistSkillDisplay.ipynb: The primary notebook for the experiment, including preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and findings.
requirements.txt: Lists the packages and their versions used in this project.
Environment Folder (NewTrustageVEnv): Contains the virtual environment setup for this project, ensuring reproducibility and consistent execution.
Getting Started

Set Up the Environment:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Create a virtual environment and activate it.
Install the required packages by running pip install -r notebooks/requirements.txt in your command line or terminal.
Run the Notebook:
Navigate to the notebooks folder.
Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and open DataScientistSkillDisplay.ipynb.
Run the cells sequentially to understand the preprocessing, analysis, and modeling steps.
Explore the Models:
The top three models from the experiment are stored in the models folder.
Use Python's pickle module to load and interact with these models.
Additional Information

This repository focuses on the modeling aspect of the credit risk analysis project. If you're interested in learning more about setting up continuous data pipelines from different sources and production pipelines for monitoring and refreshing models, I am open to providing further assistance and insights.
